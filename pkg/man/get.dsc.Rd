A list of n elements, with n the number of groups in the analysis. Each element is a list with two data frames, 
the single and aggregated descriptives of the corresponding group. Single descriptives give for each dimension 
the number of observations, mean, standard deviation and variance of the corresponding estimate, i.e. the WLE
or the plausible values (PVs). When descriptives for PVs are read in, mean, standard deviation and variance for 
each pausible value is given. Aggregated descriptives give mean, standard deviation and variance of the standard error 
of corresponding estimate. When descriptives vor plausible values are read in, aggregated descriptives gibt also 
mean, standard deviation and variance of all plausible values.
